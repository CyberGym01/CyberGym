           <h2>SNACK</h2>
            <p>Snacks are small meals that a person eats between the main meals during the pre-noon and afternoon periods, with the aim of satisfying hunger.
                Eating snacks arbitrarily harms the body because it increases useless calories. Knowing that the traditional snack meal (chips, chocolate) adds to your daily food large amounts of saturated and unwanted fats.
                It is very important to know that eating saturated fats is linked to some health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer.</p>

        <h2>MEALS</h2>
        <p>There is always a debate about eating three main daily meals, or eating several small meals during the day and which is better, the fact is that human health is not affected by the frequency of meals as much as by the quality of food consumed during the day.
            Consuming a variety of healthy foods that contain fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, and eating less foods rich in sodium, fat and calories during your daily diets, helps improve your overall health.
             But at the same time, it is advised to avoid eating food as soon as others eat it. Rather, a specific schedule for meals must be established to avoid consuming excess calories.</p>

            <h2>YOGA</h2>
                    <p>Yoga exercises are a system of healing between theory and practice as their purpose is to create strength, awareness, and harmony between the mind and body.
